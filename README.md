Select "I am a new user." Fill out the application.

:rotating_light: NOTE: You will be asked to input credit card information. The GitHub Developer Pack will cover all costs so nothing will be charged on your card.

Choose the “basic” support plan when prompted. After completing the AWS account application, you should receive a confirmation email.

Now to get our AWS account ID!

Go to the [AWS website](https://aws.amazon.com/) and sign in by clicking on the "Sign in to Console" button. Select the "Manage Account" section

After completing the student application, you should receive a confirmation email about your app being under review. You should receive receive an email from AWS within 24 hours about your application being approved.

Now you're ready!
