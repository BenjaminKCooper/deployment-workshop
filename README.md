## Teams

Teams of ~5 will be formed around dates and a set of potential topics. Your and your team may chose 1 or 2 technologies from the list or may suggest alternative related technologies/topics.

## Setup

If your tutorial requires any lengthy download or install procedures please let the class know at least 2 days in advance.

## Details


### Presentation Section

~(10-15 minutes)

* motivate the technology
* show where the technology fits into the web dev process (dev tool, frontend framework, preprocessor, language etc)
* show some use cases
* discuss pros/cons

You may use any presentation technology, although [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) is particularly fitting as an open source javascript library, and supports code blocks. :gem:

### Tutorial Section

(~30 minutes)

Your written tutorial document will be a walkthrough of building something using the specific web technologies.

It should include:

* Overview of what will be attempted
* Any necessary setup steps
* Step by step instructions
* Explanations of the what **and** the why behind each step. Try to include:
  * higher level concepts
  * best practices

Remember to explain any notation you are using.

```javascript
/* and use code blocks for any code! */
```
